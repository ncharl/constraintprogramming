`sat-nqueens.py` = n queens problem solved using pysat

`smt-nqueens.py` = n queens problem solved using pysmt

`smt-subsetsum.py` = pysmt implementation to solve the subset sum problem

`subsetsum-count.cpp` = small C++ script that enumerates all subsets and returns which sums only occurred once, used to make a hard subset sum problem
